<!-- # Product — presskit.html -->

<!--
  **This is your product or game page**. It should focus on _ONLY_ one product. This is not a replacement for your product's website, but a quick way for the press to know it faster.

  [Check the actual rendered page for the code you'll find below.](http://pixelnest.io/presskit.html/example/product/)

  If you don't have a `data.xml` yet, the easiest way to start is to run this command in your presskit folder:

  ```bash
  presskit new -t product
  ```

  Then, open the generated `data.xml` file and fill the blanks while following this guide.

  <hr>

  For your company' `data.xml`, [refer to the company documentation](../company/).

  <hr>
-->

<!-- Don't forget to set your XML header correctly. -->
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<!--
  Use a `<product>` or `<game>` tag.
-->

  <!-- ## Relations -->

  <!--
    You can specify relations between products using the `<relations>` tag.


    Then, on this page product, you will see a new line in the factsheet:

    ```
    DLC:
    My Super Game: Ultimate Edition
    ```

    Of course, the `Product Name` value is clickable.

    In the related product page, a new value will also be added:

    ```
    DLC of:
    My Super Game
    ```

    _Obviously, since the name we provide in the example is not a real product (ie., the product data.xml does not exist), this tag will be ignored for this page._

    You can have as many relations as you want. You can use it to show DLCs, expansions, sequels, prequels, etc.

    **Warning**: you need to rebuild the presskit to see the changes.

  <!-- ## Description & History -->

  <!-- Describe your product here. Be brief. -->
  <description>
    You are a screen-addicted student stuck in a maze (Shields Library) studying late at night, and you’ve lost track of the time. Your phone is about to run out of battery, and you need to find an outlet before your phone dies. Eduroam is down again and you have no data. The library lights have gone out already, so the only source of light you have left at your disposal is your phone’s flashlight. You’ll need to manage your power very carefully if you want to escape with your life and find that outlet. Your phone’s flashlight can be made brighter to increase your range of sight, at the expense of lowering your battery faster. If your phone battery dies before you find the outlet, you will be stuck in the library’s labyrinth without any source of light to navigate, thus losing the game.

  <!--
    Tell the story of your product with the `<history>` tag.

    You have two possibilities here.

    - Use an `<history>` block like in the example.
    - Or use an `<histories>` block if you have tons of things to say.

    You can't have both.

    You can see an example of the `<histories>` block in the company page.
  -->
  <history>
    We wanted to make a game that would be relatable for our peers as students at UC Davis, while also blending in the theme of "power down". We brainstormed many ideas, such as having a device run out of battery(hence "power down"), a general puzzle game, a complex dynamic between abilities and resource management, and simple but impactful art and music. We ended up combining all our ideas together to make MazeRush.

  <!-- ## About -->

  <!--
    An "About Your Company" section is automatically generated from the content of the company page.

    This <abouts> tag is completely **optional**. If you don't want this section, just delete it. But sometimes, you want to add a description for a partner.

    This is this the place to do it.

    For example, if you have a publisher, you can speak a bit more about it here.

    Most of the time, you should link that to the <partner> tag above, if you want to explain a partner a bit more. But you could use this section for other purpose.

    The <link> tag is optional.

    Add yourself, of course, but also your collaborators, freelancers and/or partners for example.

    The `<role>` tag can be anything you want. But we recommend to, at least, put the company name for the founders/employees. This will distinguish this person from the external collaborators.

    The `<website>` tag is optional.
